Can (a== 1 && a ==2 && a==3) ever evaluate to true?

Is it ever possible that (a== 1 && a ==2 && a==3) could evaluate to
true in JavaScript?

This is an interview question asked by a major tech company. It
happened two weeks back, but I'm still trying to find the answer. I
know we never write such code in our day-to-day job, but I'm curious.

# Do Something here.

if ($a == 1 && $a == 2 && $a == 3 ) {
    print "Just A Perl Hacker";
}
